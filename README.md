# Alex's Data Analytics Portfolio 

Hello, everyone! 

My name is Alejandro (Alex). Welcome to my data analytics portfolio where I will be maintaining a list of relevant projects demonstrating my skills with Python(Pandas), R, PowerBI, and Tableau along with technical analysis and insights of data sets. I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Applied Statistics from California State University, Long Beach. My work history includes work as a Student Data Analyst and Database Support for the Department of Conservation and a full time position as a Business Analyst working for Howmet Aerospace. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a data analyst or similar position.

#### [Exploratory Analysis of Roller Coasters](https://github.com/a2ooh/Alexs-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Roller%20Coasters.ipynb)
**Description:** The dataset was otained through Kaggle.com and contains 1087 observation and 56 variables as of 2022. Each observation represents a unique roller coaster and its respective attributes including coaster name, location, opening date, build material, speed, height, etc.   
**Skills:** Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

##### [Analysis of BTC and ETH Price Changes](https://github.com/alejandroarellano1/Alexs-Portfolio/blob/main/BTC_ETH_Prices_Analysis.ipynb)

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

##### [Comparison of Regression Models](https://github.com/a2ooh/Alexs-Portfolio/blob/main/Comparison%20of%20Regression%20Models.pdf)
**Description:** Exploratory comparison of over 20 regression models. Used the distribution or characteristics of data frames to determine the viability of using a particular regression or model for analysis. Also explored fitted models for each of the regressions for preditive analysis purposes.     
**Skills:** Predictive analysis, regression, data analysis, feature understanding.   
**Technology:** R, R-Studio, R Libraries

##### [Prediciton of International Bittering Units of Beer using Box-Cox and Gamma](https://github.com/alejandroarellano1/Alexs-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Beer%20IBU%20with%20Gamma%20and%20Box-Cox.pdf)
**Description:** The data was obtained through Kaggle.com and is called Brewer's Friend Beer Recipes. It contains 69,702 observations and 23 variables where each observation represents a unique beer. The data was explored and cleaned understanding the shape of its distribution to be right skewed thus justifying the use of the Box-Cox Transformation and Gamma regression for further analysis. The models are then used to predict the IBU (International Bittering Units) or level of bitterness of a particular beer profile.
